   	  	No designer represents the seismic changes that fashion underwent in the 2010s quite like Jonathan Anderson. He was a wunderkind at the start of the decade, showing provocative deadhead teddy bear prints, ultra-slim knits, and ruffled bermuda shorts at London Fashion Week: Men’s. By the end of it, he’d become a creator so prolific and influential that Vogue’s headline for his Fall 2019 Loewe show simply read: “Jonathan Anderson at Loewe: He’s Really Good at this Stuff.”
   	  	<br><br>
   	  	The story of how a Northern Irish graduate of the Royal College of Art-turned-Prada merchandiser with minimal industry clout became one of fashion’s defining voices is surprising, to say the least. But subverting expectations is Anderson’s thing: While many have called fashion’s current creative director model a failure, citing burnout and ever-shifting brand identities, his tenure at Loewe suggests the opposite. Other designers stake claims for incessant reinvention, but Anderson has firmly rooted himself in a dialogue with history. If his peers are building empires on hype; Anderson is building his on thoughtfulness.
   	  	<br><br>
   	  	Mindfulness, care, craft, and passion can be tricky ideas to sell in the backlit world of digital imagery and endless scrolling—and, in some sense, the projects Anderson has undertaken at his eponymous brand and at Loewe could seem difficult in industry reliant on instant gratification. The tentpoles of 2010s fashion—celebrity endorsements and influencer marketing—are barely part of the Anderson vernacular, and when they are, it’s in the form of campaigns with Killing Eve’s Jodie Comer and partnerships with Visual AIDs to celebrate the work of David Wojnarowicz. He’s more likely to collaborate with obscure, often deceased artists and their estates than with cool new It kids. And his idea of luxury isn’t only about the finest leather and lace, but about also the poetry of beauty.
   	  	<br><br>
   	  	As Anderson tells it, he’s just doing him. Within seconds of sitting down on a frigid December morning, a day where he was scheduled to the minute, he was instantly riffing, questioning, positing. He knows exactly what he wants to say, but he’s also open to new ideas. That’s actually the most charming thing about Anderson—and the reason he’s a worthy poster boy for this decade and this industry: his voracious appetite for knowledge, progress, and evolution.
   	  	<br><br>
   	  	On the eve of his Loewe men’s show, we’re posting excerpts from that conversation, one in which Anderson advocates for open-mindedness, craft, and creativity above all else.

   	      <p class="q">
   	  	    Where were you at the start of the 2010s?

   	    </div>
   	    <div class="answer">
   	      <p class="a">
   	      	Where was I? I had started my brand a little bit doing menswear, and everything, probably, was quite simple then. It was blogs, not Instagram. It was magazines, not the internet, really. Fashion was probably a little bit in the dark ages, but it was the beginning, if that makes sense. It was a really nice beginning, because I felt like I had the space and time to fall into my own aesthetic without rushing into it.
   	      </p>

   	<div class="wrap">
   	    <div class="question">
   	  	  <p class="q">
   	  	  	What was the transition like, first launching women’s at JW and then when Loewe came along?
   	      </p>
   	    </div>
   	    <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  	I started doing women’s because department stores were asking for versions of the men’s for women, so it was a very literal transition. Then, I started to enjoy doing women’s, and started working into it more and exploring it more. It was like everything fell in naturally. When I was offered the Loewe [position], I didn’t really have any landmark for it, so it was like a startup. It was a very historical brand that needed a new direction, and it was just an enjoyable process to be able to dive into something without my name on it.

   	 </div>
   	 <div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  	At Loewe you took some time, about 18 months, from when you started to when you showed your first collection.
   	    </p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  	Yeah.

   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  	What were you doing during this period?
   	    </p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  	Loewe needed a lot of thinking. I needed to think about the logo. I needed to just really understand what went wrong with this brand, and what went right with it over so many years. It was just one of those things where I just wanted to experiment. I don’t think we would be in the position that we’re in now, if we didn’t have that year. I always think, if you get it wrong in the first season, it is very difficult to get it right again. I think the first show is what stipulates what’s going to happen. I think some people underestimate that show, in terms of why you do things. I can see it in other brands, when people rush into it. I think when you rush into it, you don’t really know what you’re doing.
   	    </p>

   	</div>
   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  	Were you faced with any pushback from LVMH about not producing anything new for a year?
   	    </p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  	No. I think what was great is that Delphine [Arnault, the director and vice president of LVMH] was very understanding. I think she understood what I wanted to do. That’s what I enjoy with Delphine, she trusts in what you want to do and gives you the platform to do it in. So, I was very lucky.

   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  	Looking back on the past decade, we’ve been reflecting on the creative director model and whether or not it is viable for the future. Why do you think what you do at Loewe has become a success story within the creative director model?
   	    </p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  	I think it’s about continuity. Maybe it’s also just [that] you’ve got to get the job done. I don’t think you can be a fantasist [now] as much as you used to. You can—but I think there is a reality check that needs to be done within it. I run my own business and it is incredibly difficult. With Loewe, I want to take this brand to a certain level, and it’s not there yet, so I’m there until it’s done. And will it ever be done? I’m not sure. And by the time it works, I’ll want to reconstruct it again.

   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  	Recently, your collections have become more consistent from season to season. There used to be a hard pivot. Is that a personal change, or an industry change, or both?
   	    </p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		I think I just want to reinforce things. I think we do a lot of things, and then they become part of the mainstream, so I think it’s better to actually get your mileage out of each idea.
   	  		<br><br>
   	  		I also think this job is not only [runway] shows. I think this is the big illusion in this industry, that it’s just about shows, but it’s not, really. It’s about visual merchandising, it’s about stores, it’s about advertising, and those things take up at least 70 percent of my job. The shows are a smaller proportion. And sometimes, people don’t want to hear that. I think they imagine me—

   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		—Off in a high tower, trying to be elusive and creative, but in the end, it is a continual dialogue with all levels. You cannot just focus on shows because it’s not just what makes a brand work.

   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		I always say that JW Anderson is a cultural agitator and Loewe is cultural, it processes the culture. JW Anderson is more to agitate, to get things wrong.

   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		Creatively, how do you sustain the level of productivity you’re at—16 seasonal collections a year between both brands, men’s and women’s—especially when you are touching all of these different components beyond the runways?
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		I think you have to be continually curious about things. That’s why I enjoy collaborations. That’s why I enjoy doing what I do, because I am continually trying to find new things. And if you can’t find new things, then don’t do the job. Truly, I think it’s one of those things.

   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		Your life has certainly changed over this decade. How do you feel that your aesthetics have changed?
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		I think my aesthetic has evolved, definitely. I think it’s become more refined or more balanced in a way. I think the overall bones of it are the same. There’s an oddity to it. It’s very textural. There’s always been a focus on craft, and I think that just continues.
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	</div>
   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		Do you think that craft can or will innovate in the next decade?
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		Craft is innovation. Weaving is probably one of the oldest techniques and it’s still going today. I don’t think I own it, I’m just painting it in a different way. When I first joined Loewe I went to the Prado, and I walked down this incredibly long corridor of some of the greatest works in history from the Royal collection. There was a Reubens and a Titian, side by side, both of Adam and Eve. They looked identical. But they were by Reubens and Titian.
   	  		<br><br>
   	  		I went through a phase where I didn’t believe that fashion was art, but I do believe that it is a reflection of society, so, therefore it is an art form. It is an interpretation, and it is fine to reinvent. If Reubens can reinvent Titian, then this is fine. For me, that’s the history of the universe there, because ultimately it is about the passing of information. I don’t go out to say that I started something and I own it; I just work with things. I think this idea of ownership of design is just ridiculous. I don’t own anything. I make it, I put it out there. That’s it. I move on.
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	</div>
   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		It has to be a dialogue. The entire history of art is a dialogue with the past, trying to re-establish codes for the future.
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		That’s what it’s always been. I think now we’ve become obsessed by the idea of ownership, but the whole point is not to have ownership. Ownership is the most dangerous thing for creativity. Look at John Galliano, one of the greatest designers in history. He was about reinterpreting history. There will never be someone like that again, if we continue in this way. Because it should be about looking at the past in a different way and not about owning something. It is about experiencing it. That is why this job can be so exciting.
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	</div>
   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		You talked about a 70% versus 30% balance between marketing and designing. How do you want to innovate in those realms, thinking about the next 10 years?
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		My whole thing is about putting craft at the forefront. The actual making process, actually why we do these things, and who the people are who are involved. For me, I just want to really explain that these things do not grow on trees. Everyone’s talking about the environment, but I think if we understood the reality of how these things are made, and the people and jobs involved, then we might be able to appreciate [a product] more. I think we need to relish things instead of dispose [of them].
   	  		<br><br>
   	  		In the next 10 years... Well, it depends on where this industry goes. I feel like there is little respect for craft. Things are just consumed and spit out. I actually work with some of the most incredible craftspeople in the world. They are the people that I want to talk about. I want to use myself as a platform. I mean, I don’t really have anything else to offer. I would rather do things that have merit, and if it takes time, it takes time.

   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		We were talking about this the other day, how the ability to collect data so quickly has changed the way that we perceive success.
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		That’s how business is trying to work. There are things out there that are successful, or perceived to be so, but that’s just marketing. If you cannot speak about the product that you make and believe in the people that make it, then [it doesn’t] matter if that product is successful or not. It doesn’t make any sense. Sometimes it can be quite difficult, especially if you’re a creative. I see myself as a creative person, and I sometimes get slightly demoralized by where it is now. I find that is probably due to politics, that no one questions politics. They do, but they don’t know how to question it the right way. Life is a spoken mirror and we’re now in a moment where the mirror is incredibly muddied.

   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		Yeah. I try to stay out of them as much as I can. I just feel like fashion is my job. I go home and I leave it at the back door. I used to take it home [with me] and get very obsessed with it, but when I talk to my parents, they say, “It’s a job,” so, I do the job, I go home, and then I have my own world. It’s my own private world, and that’s it. I give a lot to my work, and I need to keep something.

   	<div class="wrap">
   	  <div class="question">
   	  	<p class="q">
   	  		Through the projects you’ve done at JW and Loewe, you’ve started to talk about larger issues like politics, sexuality, gender, equality. How important is it for you to participate in these socio-political conversations?
   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		I don’t believe a brand should have a political viewpoint, because that’s a different thing. I do this as a personal edit, and if the consumer does not like the edit, then I don’t want to sell to them. When I first joined Loewe, I remember we did photographs of Steven Meisel kissing [a man]. That was a scandal at one point, putting those images in some stores. … We work with Visual AIDs. We work with charity organizations, with Knot on My Planet, for example, and we work with local artisans in India. All these different initiatives, they’re not just PR stunts, they are just things I believe in.
   	  		<br><br>
   	  		There are a lot of things out there that, I think, become a kind of stunt. We’re not here to be carbon neutral just to say it. If we’re going to be carbon neutral, we’re going to do it properly—and it’s not going to happen overnight. But we live in this very strange moment where—and I’ve been at the harsh end of it on many occasions—where people are incredibly angry. I think it has to do with boredom, maybe, or people that are lost in society, or there is not a support system for certain people.

   	  	</p>
   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		The only way I can describe it is recreational outrage. We are outraged by everything. We are more obsessed with failure today than we are with success. Because success is petrifying for people, whereas failure is easy to manage. I find that part of the job, now, incredibly difficult. I like a viewpoint, but I like people who think before they speak. I think there’s a lot of not thinking before we say things. We spit a lot of venom up just to get likes. If society continues in that way, I don’t think creativity can exist. … We should be supporting each other to try to make it in this industry. Anyone who works in fashion will tell you that it’s incredibly difficult. I admire anyone who does it because I know the reality of it and it’s not an easy ride. And I think now that everyone’s a critic...
   	  		<br><br>
   	  		Designers are not perfect. I say this about every designer. It’s a very difficult moment because you want to try to be creative, and creativity is about taking in the world, and doing it in your way. I think in the end, you have to do what is right for you. I’m not here to please an industry, I’m here to challenge it. I think we have to be challenging things or we will fall into the Victorian era very quickly. That’s quite petrifying because fashion is not about digressing. It’s about going forward. So, I hope in the next 10 years that we become more rational as people, because if not, then what’s the point?

   	  </div>
   	  <div class="answer">
   	  	<p class="a">
   	  		No. The problem is, I am my toughest critic. If I thought I was a success story, then I would quit and do something else. The success story is never ending. I think, sometimes, I would rather not know where I’m at in a single moment, because I feel the minute you do, then you’ve already climbed that mountain. For me, the mountain is incredibly high. You’ve got to keep the mountain high because if you get to the top, then it’s incredibly boring.
